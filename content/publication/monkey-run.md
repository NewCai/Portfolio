# Introduction
</center>
Monkey Run is a platform running game with only one-finger control. Two levels of jump are designed, an amazing long-jump and a naughty short-jump. Your goal is to run
through the forest and avoid enemies to grab as many as fruits.

Monkey Run is the first game I made. I designed and developed the game independently with royalty-free art works.
